parody of Katy Perry - Firework about a man striving for success 
Verse 1:
I used to be just like the rest
A regular Joe, just doing my best
But now I'm chasing after fame
I'll do whatever it takes, it's my claim to claim

Chorus:
Watch me burn like a firework
My ambition's high, it's like a perk
Watch me soar, watch me climb
Watch me make it, in record time

Verse 2:
I'll work hard, I'll never tire
I'll climb the ladder, higher and higher
I'll leave the doubters in the dust
My determination is a must

Chorus:
Watch me burn like a firework
My ambition's high, it's like a perk
Watch me soar, watch me climb
Watch me make it, in record time

Bridge:
I'll shine bright like a diamond in the sky
My success, it's only a matter of time
I'll light up the night, I'll light up the day
I'll make it to the top, come what may

Chorus:
Watch me burn like a firework
My ambition's high, it's like a perk
Watch me soar, watch me climb
Watch me make it, in record time

Outro:
Watch me burn like a firework
I'll make it to the top, it's my big perk
